# PostgreSQL: PGO

Getting PostgreSQL right was a top priority when creating our stack. It is the database which hosts our most critical data so failure here wasn't an option. Luckily there are plenty of production ready Kubernetes operators available for Kubernetes. After looking at a bunch of them we settled on [PGO](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator), aka. Crunchy Postgres Operator.
