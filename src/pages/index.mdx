# Reclaim the Stack!

In 2022 the platform team at Mynewsdesk spent 7 months building out a Kubernetes based platform to replace Heroku for our SaaS product.
The results were a 90% reduction in costs ($200,000 -> $20,000/year) and a 30% improvement in performance (115ms -> 82ms average latency). We also significantly improved developer experience with reduced deploy times and faster / more accessible tooling.

We have now open sourced the entire stack so you can do the same, but in a few days instead of 7 months.

It's time to Reclaim the Stack!
