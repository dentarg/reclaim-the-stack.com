# Elasticsearch: Elastic Cloud Kubernetes

Selecting a Kubernetes operator for Elasticsearch was relatively straight forward given that the Elastic team themselves provide a well made open source operator called [Elastic Cloud Kubernetes](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-cloud-kubernetes).

### Pros

- Created by the maintainers of Elasticsearch
- Well documented
- Seems stable
- Easy to deploy connected Kibana instance when creating a cluster

### Cons

- No declarative backups (you can setup snapshot management via Kibana manually instead)
- No out of the box possibility of single node clusters without ending up in “yellow” status (shows as "degraded" in ArgoCD)

## Alternatives Considered

### KubeDB
