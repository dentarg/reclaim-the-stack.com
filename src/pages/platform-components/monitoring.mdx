# Monitoring: kube-prometheus-stack

The [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) is pretty much a de-facto standard for Kubernetes monitoring. It includes:

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/): an in-memory database for storing metrics
- [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/): a tool for sending metrics based alerts
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/): a dashboarding tool for visualizing metrics and logs.

And a bunch of integrations with Kubernetes components.

### Pros

- Easy to get going
- Well adopted
- High development velocity
- Supports a ton of things out of the box
- Seems to work well

### Cons

- Hard to wrap head around, installs a lot of components which can end up feeling a bit like a black box
- Do we actually want / need all of it?
- Grafana doesn't always provide a user experience on par with commercial observability / log aggregation products
