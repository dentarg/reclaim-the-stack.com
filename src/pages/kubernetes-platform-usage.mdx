# Kubernetes Platform: Usage

Once you have the platform installed we recommend deploying our [sample application](https://github.com/reclaim-the-stack/rails-example) to get a feel for how the platform works. The sample application is a simple Ruby on Rails application using Postgres as main database, Redis for pub/sub + background job processing and Elasticsearch for full text search.

To interact with the platform you will be making use of [k](https://github.com/reclaim-the-stack/k), a CLI tool we built to manage all day to day devops tasks (think of it as the `heroku` CLI tool but faster and... better ðŸ•º)

In the following screencast we will cover both installation of `k` and deployment of the sample application. Note that the screencast was recorded before we added Elasticsearch to the application. How to add Elasticsearch is covered in the application [README](https://github.com/reclaim-the-stack/rails-example#deployment).
