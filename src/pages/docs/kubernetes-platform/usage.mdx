# Kubernetes Platform: Usage

Once you have the platform installed we recommend deploying our [sample application](https://github.com/reclaim-the-stack/rails-example) to get a feel for how the platform works. The sample application is a simple Ruby on Rails application using Postgres as it's primary database, Redis for pub/sub and background job processing, and Elasticsearch for full text search.

To interact with the platform, you'll use [k](https://github.com/reclaim-the-stack/k), a CLI tool we developed for managing all day-to-day DevOps tasks. Think of it as the `heroku` CLI tool but faster and... better ðŸ•º.

In the following screencast we will cover both installation of `k` and deployment of the sample application. Note that the screencast was recorded before we added Elasticsearch to the application. Instructions on how to add Elasticsearch are provided in the application's [README](https://github.com/reclaim-the-stack/rails-example#deployment).
