# Platform Components

In this section we will cover the components that make up the platform. A lot of the time spent building the platform was spent comparing alternatives and making decisions on what to use. To not only help you understand how to use the components, but also understand the decisions we made, we include an Architecture Decision Record for each component.

Note that if you are going to be an administrator of the platform, you should eventually take your time to go deeper and get a solid understanding of all these components. Keep in mind that the Reclaim the Stack platform is just a collection of open source software, each having their own separate documentation sites and support communities. You may even want to replace some of the components with alternatives that better fit your needs.

We also recommend that you get familiar with the [platform-applications](https://github.com/reclaim-the-stack/get-started/tree/master/platform-applications) directory in the GitOps repository where the installation manifests for all the components are located. This will help you understand how the components are installed and configured behind the scenes.
