# Introduction to the Platform

The Reclaim the Stack Platform is a fully open source Kubernetes-based deployment platform which can be easily deployed on bare metal as well as cloud. It is designed to replace Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings like Heroku, and to provide a fully featured, easy to use platform for deploying web applications.

We gave a talk about the motivations and approach for building out the platform at TalosCon in 2023 which serves as a good introduction.
